# Lagos Real Estate Market Analysis
## Overview
This project explores housing price patterns across Lagos, Nigeria using a cleaned dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal was to understand how location, property type, and neighorhood exclusivity influence housing prices. The vizualisation is an interactive Tableau dashboard that highlights price patterns and provides a clear visual summary of the Lagos real estate market.

* Property type (flat, duplex, etc.)
* Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
* Coordinates (latitude and longtitude)
* Facilities (inlcuding: swimming pool, boy's quarters, new building, located within an estate)

## Key Questions
This analysis aims to answer three core questions:
1. Which Lagos locations have the highest property prices?
2. How do prices vary across different property types?
3. Does neighborhood exclusivity correlate with higher prices?

## Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard includes three main charts:
1. **Average Price by Location** - This shows the most and least expensive areas in Lagos.
Banana Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island stand out as the most expensive neighborhoods.

2. **Average Price by Property Type** - This compares pricing across different property types such as bungalows, flats, terraces, duplexes, detached duplexes and other property categories.

3. **Average Price by Neighborhood Tier (1–5)** - This illustrates how the exclusivity of the neghborhood might impact the price of the property. Tier 5 neighborhoods are significantly more expensive.
